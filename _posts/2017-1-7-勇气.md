    Finally I make up my mind
    You are the one I want to find
    How I wish I could stay by your side
    I promise wherever I will follow you
    Life is not easy as you told
    Hrer I am always trying to convince my soul
    Unwilling to hear you lose your hope
    If you love me tell me so
    I love you or te amo
    Above suspicion,you're my whole
    But you are irresolute
    When you hold me in your arms never never be apart
    I can feel you when you go so far your love is in my palm inside my heart
    Finally I make up my mind
    You are the one I want to find
    How I wish I could stay by your side
    I promise wherever I will follow you
    Life is not easy as you told
    Here I am always trying to convince my soul
    Unwilling to hear you lose your hope
    If you love me tell me so
    I love you or te amo
    Above suspicion, you're my whole
    But you are irresolute
    When you hold me in your arms never never be apart
    I can feel you when you go so far your love is in my palm inside my heart Maybe someday you have to go
    Let me be the first one to know
    I will give my diary to you
    Everyday I write it out of love, just for you
